### The Emperor's Due

Adepts of the codex will, to the best of their financial ability, support Little Wars through purchase of snacks, hobby supplies, and models. Adepts are encouraged to preorder items they know they will be getting at release through Little Wars.

The only way we expect the store to support us is if the 40k community support's them.

### Know no Fear

Adepts should make no attempt to be intimidating or unkind to new members of the community.
New members of the community should meet, ask questions, and come to know existing members of the 40k community.
